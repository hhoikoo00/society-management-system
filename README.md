# Society Management System

## Introduction

This is an application I developed in High School for the IB Computer Science course, specifically for the Internal Assessment (IA) component that aims to solve a problem for a real client by developing an application.

The program mainly uses Java and the Swing toolkit for GUI. It also uses HyperSQL as a DBMS, predominantly because it allows a file-based database system without needing to host a server, and back then I did not know how to create a standalone application that hosts a server by itself.

## Disclaimer

This project was developed a while ago (in 2018) when I was much less confident and knowledgeable at programming, so this may seem less polished.
